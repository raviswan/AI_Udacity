PROBABILITY


- For Conditional Probability, remember picking a 4 from a deck given a red card. Arrive at the answer with intuition, and use the formula
- Monty Hall Problem:
- Monty Hall Problem : Is solved by using Baye's theorem. Where one conditional probability is expressed by the reverse conditional probability and unconditional probability. Remember the formula.


-Geometric Mean:
	Of 2,4,8 : cube-root of 2*4*8 
	of 4*4 : square root of 16 = 4

	It is typically used when you are comparsing across different sets . Refer to wiki


Generalized p-Mean : Remember the formula

p=1 is arithmetic mean
p = 0  is geometric mean
p=-1 harmonic mean

p =-inf returns min of values
p = max returns max of values
